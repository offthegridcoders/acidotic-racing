          We are very fortunate to have some amazingly talented people shoot photos at our events. At nearly every aR race our team photographer, Gianina Lindsey, provides free photos through her Facebook page, SNAPacidotic.</br></br>Check it out, give it a "Like", and then use the images as you wish. All we ask is that you credit her appropriately ("courtesy of Gianina Lindsey").</br></br>And at some of our larger races you might see professional photographers Joe Viger and/or Scott Mason. These gentlemen have taken some of the most iconic images of endurance events in the northeast. Please visit their websites and browse their galleries.
