        <p>All acidotic RACING athletes have committed to displaying the highest measure of sportsmanship while racing with the utmost tenacity.  For us it's not where you finish, but how you finish that matters most.  These athletes represent nearly every endurance sport out there.  While we favor "off-road" challenges, many of us race "on-road" as well.  We have athletes throughout New England racing most of the regional foot and bike race series.  Interested in joining our community?  Send us a note.</p>
