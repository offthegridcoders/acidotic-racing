          <p>As a race director and an athlete, I understand that no detail is too small. Our organization strives to host professional race services in a diverse multitude of endurance pursuits.</p>

          <p>Our mission is to host uncompromisingly excellent events in beautiful locations on challenging courses and to make every competitor feel as though they are important and valuable to us.</p>

We are committed to supporting charitable organizations that are dear to us through a variety of outlets associated with our professional event services. Every event we host benefits a non-profit organization named by the race director.
