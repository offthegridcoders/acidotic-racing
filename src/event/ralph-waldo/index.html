        <h4>course details</h4>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">The race will take place on the City of Concord's Winant Park Trails. Located close to downtown Concord the trails offer a beautiful taste of windy singletrack, switchbacks with breathtaking views of the capital area and nordic-type paths.  The approximately 9 mile long course will be more of the same!
        </br></br>We are pleased to note this event will be a 100% fundraiser for the Ralph Waldo Emerson School for Preschoolers in Concord, NH Ralph Waldo Emerson School for Preschoolers is a nondenominational, nonprofit organization founded in 1966, offering morning and afternoon programs for three, four and five-year-old children. Emerson School is accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs. Emerson's classrooms and woodland playground create a beautiful space that is rich in potential. Their curriculum is shared and created by both teachers and children working together. They believe that children learn best through what they do best - through their play. Their teachers closely observe children's play and then offer further opportunities for children to reflect on and revisit their experiences. Emerson School's uniqueness results from relationships between families, teachers, and a parent volunteer Board of Directors. These partnerships have been the essence of Emerson for over 40 years and the key to their continued success.</p>
