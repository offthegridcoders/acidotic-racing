        <h4>event details</h4>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">
          <strong>These championships are open to all.  You do not need to qualify to race this event.  Everyone is welcome!</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">Snowshoe racing is a uniquely regional sport and in our opinion there is NO region with a more vibrant and competitive scene than the northeast!  That's why the <strong>Northeast Snowshoe Federation</strong> was formed.  It's mission is to promote and the grow the sport of snowshoe racing here in the northeast and host a regional championship every winter.  This winter, we here in New Hampshire are THRILLED to host the event!  Next winter it'll rotate to another location in the region.  And to increase the competitiveness (and the fun) we will combine the New Hampshire championship with this regional finale.  So, the <strong>Granite State Snowshoe Series</strong> participants have a championship of their own and the regional snowshoe racing family gets a chance to come together in one grand race!</br></br>
        The course is being finalized but expect the distance to be about 10k with a good deal of climbing, breathtaking views, wide carriage roads, and some amazing singletrack.</p>

        <h5>prizes</h5>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">Thanks to our series sponsor, DION Snowshoes, one lucky snowshoer will win a pair of the model 121's.</p>

        <h5>One Warm Hat</h5>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">We will also continue the tradition helping the less fortunate in our community and will do so by collecting gently used and clean warm hats at all of our winter events in 2015. These hat are collected through our One Warm Hat program and donated directly to New Horizons of New Hampshire in Manchester. Thank you in advance for your support.</p>

          <p class="no-extra-padding">Updated 09/17/2009)</p>

          <p class="no-extra-padding">New Hampshire winter weather can be very unpredictable and occasionally make travel hazardous. For the safety of our volunteers, competitors, and family a final determination on the status of our races will be made the Thursday prior to each race. The status of the race ("ON" or "POSTPONED") will be detailed on each individual race webpage. You must check each race webpage prior to the race to assure the race will be held. Every attempt will be made to reschedule all postponed events. Pre-registered competitors will be given a refund or rain check. </p>
