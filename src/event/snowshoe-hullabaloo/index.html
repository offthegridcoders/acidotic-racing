          <h2>United States Snowshoe Association</h2>
          <p>Due to the early northeast snowshoe race postponements, reschedules, and cancellations the United States Snowshoe Association has just announced that they are adding our Exeter Snowshoe Hullabaloo as a regional qualifier for the US Snowshoe Championships. You must be a member of the USSA to qualify. Day of event USSA membership applications will be available. Payment is due onsite. For more information visit the USSA at http://www.snowshoeracing.com/</p>

        <h4>course details</h4>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">The Snowshoe Hullabaloo is run over almost 4 miles of tight and twisted, packed single track in the Henderson-Swazey (aka Ft. Rock) Woods in Exeter, NH. The course is a pulse-raising roller coaster of ups, downs and hair-pin turns. Every hill is runnable, guaranteeing fast times, but there are enough of them to make sure that even the front runners will be breathing hard by the finish. The narrow rails keep it fun, but you'll have to break tracks if you want to pass. Sure to please everyone, whether racing or running, the sheer beauty of the trails will keep you occupied whether you're out for 30 minutes or an hour.</p>

        <h5>Dion Snowshoe Rentals</h5>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">A limited number of DION Snowshoes will be available to rent the day of the event. Please contact us at contact@acidoticRACING.com to reserve your pair.</p>

        <h5>One Warm Hat</h5>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">We will also continue the tradition helping the less fortunate in our community and will do so by collecting gently used and clean warm hats at all of our winter events in 2015. These hat are collected through our One Warm Hat program and donated directly to New Horizons of New Hampshire in Manchester. Thank you in advance for your support.</p>

        <h5>A portion of the proceeds to benefit</h5>
        <p class="no-extra-padding">The mission of Cocheco Valley Humane Society (CVHS) is to make possible a better world for all animals by providing shelter, educating the community about humane care and treatment, advocating animal welfare, and promoting the human animal bond.</p>

          <p class="no-extra-padding">Updated 09/17/2009</p>

          <p class="no-extra-padding">New Hampshire winter weather can be very unpredictable and occasionally make travel hazardous. For the safety of our volunteers, competitors, and family a final determination on the status of our races will be made the Thursday prior to each race. The status of the race ("ON" or "POSTPONED") will be detailed on each individual race webpage. You must check each race webpage prior to the race to assure the race will be held. Every attempt will be made to reschedule all postponed events. Pre-registered competitors will be given a refund or rain check. </p>
