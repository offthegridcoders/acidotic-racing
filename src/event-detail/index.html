        <p>Over the years our Loon Mountain Race has developed quite a following here in the northeast. The reputation as one of the region’s toughest races is due in large part to the kilometer ascent of North Peak via the black diamond trail known as Upper Walking Boss. "The Boss", as it’s affectionately known, is roughly a kilometer of grassy slope with angles that exceed a dizzying 40% grade! And recently the word has spread outside of the region as well. Our race has received a number of national accolades as well. Here they are:</p>

          <h2>Most Competitive Hillclimb</h2>
          <p>"This race up Loon Mountain is an annual benchmark on one of the country’s most competitive trail running circuits. Among the most dastardly hill climb races in the country, the course of this five-miler has an average grade of 10 percent—but in some places it ascends at an unthinkable 40 percent—as it meanders upward on a combination of dirt trails, gravel service roads, and grassy ski slopes." -RW</p>

          <h2>Trail Runners Bucket List</h2>
          <p>"Widely considered the New England Trail Running series’ most difficult event, the Loon Mountain Race in Lincoln, New Hampshire, packs a whopping 2,200-vertical gain in just 5.5 miles. Racers literally run up a mountain—the average grade is 10 percent, with some sections as steep as 40 percent. The trail winds up the ski resort’s runs, including the black-diamond pitch Upper Walking Boss, before finishing at the top gondola station on Loon peak." -OM</p>

          <h2>Dirty Dozen - America’s Best Trail Races</h2>
          <p>Running 5.5 miles with 2,200 feet of vertical gain will definitely make you question the sanity of running up Loon Peak instead of skiing down it — especially on the black-diamond ski run portion, where racers navigate a 40-percent incline. Front-runners dance up the grass ski slopes, dirt trails and service roads like mountain goats. The race has been selected as the 2014 USATF Mountain Running Championship, so you can expect to see some of the best mountain runners in the country pushing the pace.</p>

        <h5>saturday bib pick-up</h5>
        <p>Because we're starting a little earlier on Sunday morning we will offer Saturday afternoon bib pickup at Loon Mountain from 4:00-5:30 pm for any pre-registered athlete in the Governor Adams Lodge (look for the LMR Registration signs).  You can still pick up your bib Sunday morning.</p>
